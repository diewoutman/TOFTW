For those who got here and have no idea what is happening.
One thing i like about social media, is sharing my favorite tracks.
With the built in sharing functionality the spotify app gives you, it's never been more easy to share your favorite tracks.
So i have been doing this, slowly but steady.
On my instagram profile i share a track once a week in my instagram story. Most of the time it's a track i have been listening the most that week.

Because i am a programmer, and have to keep up with modern technologies, i thought let's make a little application.
This way i am able to share my favorite track beyond my instagram following.
(Real talk: what following am i talking about. ha ha ha *dies a little inside* )

Track of the week is a little angular project, made to get more familiar with the following:
- newer angular versions
- Github actions
- Github project
- SPA web design
- Spotify Api

So come and join me on this weird little adventure.
We fail, we laugh but best of all we have fun.

I leave you, with the default angular readme.
